# Pebble Dev portal

## Intro
This project is for developers of apps or watchfaces for the pebble smartwatch who want to deploy their application to the [rebble appstore](https://apps.rebble.io). As per [this post](https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki/Preparing-a-new-app-for-the-Rebble-App-Store), you can get your app on the appstore by creating a .zip with a yaml file and all the resources. This project provides a form which accepts your project resources and automatically creates the .yaml file, wrapping everything up in a nice .zip.   

It's a 'psuedo' dev portal because it does not allow direct upload of the app to the store, you must send the .zip output to @Joshua on the [rebble discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/aRUAYFN)

## Production

The production deployment is live at [willow.systems/pebble/dev-portal/](https://willow.systems/pebble/dev-portal/)
